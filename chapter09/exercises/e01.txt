The following function contains two errors:

double triangle_area(double base, height)
double product;
{
  product = base * height;
  return product / 2;
}

The first error is that the `height` parameter has no type.

The second error is that the variable `product` is not declared inside the
function body.

Corrected function:

double triangle_area(double base, double height) {
  double product;
  product = base * height;
  return product / 2;
}
