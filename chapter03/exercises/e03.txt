(a) Strings `%d` and ` %d` are equivalent.

(b) Strings `%d-%d-%d` and `%d -%d -%d` are equivalent.

(c) Strings `%f` and `%f ` are NOT equivalent. `scanf` reads white-space
characters from the input until it reaches a non-white-space character. A
space at the end of a format string keeps `scanf` open until an additional
character is input.

(d) Strings `%f,%f` and `%f, %f` are equivalent.
